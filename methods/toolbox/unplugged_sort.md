(Especially useful for mergeSort)

### Background
Casino card games shuffle multiple decks at a time.  Students will put the cards back in proper order.
Activity was developed by Erwin bribing his students with pizza.


### Participant pre-requisites
_anything students should already know to make this work well
optionally with some treatment of how necessary each pre-req is..._
* understand the A,J,Q,K ordering in a card deck (for students who may not have used standard card deck)
  * Note: Some students may have reservations about card-playing because of gambling concerns
* if to be used with writing code, students already have learned about arrays

### Scaffolding / Differentiation 
_an aspect of this activity well-suited to tiering / scaffolding / differentiation_
* ELLs - standard card deck vocab
  * Numbers: JackðŸ‚«, QueenðŸ‚­, KingðŸ‚¬, AceðŸ‚¡
  * Suits: Clubsâ™£, Spadesâ™ , Diamondsâ™¢, Heartsâ™¡ 
* Adjust level of difficulty by handing out increasing the number of decks of cards
* "Extreme fun form": have specific groups face off
* Part 2: Different ways of ordering:
  * Order by all numbers (A-K)
  * Order by all the numbers (A-K) --> suits
* Could be adapted for a Searching Activity:
  * "Who can find the King of Hearts the fastest?"

### Teacher Instructions
1. Organize students randomly into groups of 4
1. Hand out 1-4 decks of cards for each group
1. (Order pizza from yelp!) 
1. Setup teams
1. Give prompts for Activity 1
1. Have other groups check any group who says they won
   * Estimate of 5-15 minutes?
1. Class conversation:
   * "What does 'efficient' mean? "
   * "What strategies did you use to make the sorting efficient?"
   * "What would happen if you first split the cards into 2?  Would the sorting be faster?" --> types of divide & conquer sort
   * "Which type of sort comes closest to what you used?" (Provide a list of possible sorts)


### Activity Instructions (for students)
1. Get in your group
1. Shuffle the cards in your deck
1. Rotate to a different workplace (help avoid cheating)
1. Sort the cards in order (by suit and ascending order A-K)
   * Hearts > Diamonds > Clubs > Spades
   * Ace > 2....10 > Jack > Queen > King
1.  Fastest to sort wins the game
